## Warning ##

Here is listed the progression of the code - not of the content. **There is no pedagogical content for now**, we are focused on the development of the software. Content material will be added later.

## What is working ##

  * User creation and authentification
  * Lesson selector
  * Exploitation of courses and exercises
  * Audio files in courses
  * Courses and exercises validation
  * Progression saving
  * Basic progression logic integrated in the UI

## To do ##

  * Better progression logic and visual cues
  * Different kind of exercises : timed, repeated, etc.
  * Statistics about progress
  * General UI polish
  * Transitions and animation effects
  * Pedagogical material (i.e. actual ancient greek lessons)
