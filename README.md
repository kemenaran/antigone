## Summary

Antigone is a software made to help teaching the ancient greek. It includes courses, (timed) exercises, cultural sections, multimedia features, and runs under Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.

This software is derived from strong pedagogical reflexions about language (and especially ancient language) teaching. Lessons are packages independent from the software, which could probably support the teaching of any language.

Antigone is far to completion, but moves quickly. Pre-releases are issued frequently, so you can see what's going on.
